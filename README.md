# Deep Reinforcement Learning: DQN Cart Pole Benchmark task with Mac GPUs, and PyTorch

Code explaining each step of the DQN Deep RL benchmark task on a Cart Pole OpenAI gym's environment. 
You will find detailed descriptions of what each line of code does.

This code will utilise your Mac's GPUs (or if you are not on a Mac, it will default to using your machine's CPUs).
If you are a Mac user first configure your machine by following the guide here: https://www.mrdbourke.com/pytorch-apple-silicon/

On the top spec macbook pro at the time of writing, the code will take approx 15min to run.
This code was adapted from the PyTorch website: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html
